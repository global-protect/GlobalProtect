## Automating GlobalProtect VPN Connections

You can automate the process of connecting to **GlobalProtect VPN** using scripts. Below are examples of how to automatically connect to the VPN on Windows and Linux.

### Windows Auto-Connect Script

To automatically connect to **GlobalProtect VPN** on Windows, you can create a PowerShell script. Here’s an example:


`# GlobalProtect Auto Connect Script $vpnPortal = "vpn.yourcompany.com" $vpnUsername = "your-username" $vpnPassword = "your-password"  # Start GlobalProtect VPN Start-Process "C:\Program Files\Palo Alto Networks\GlobalProtect\PanGPA.exe" -ArgumentList "-portal", $vpnPortal, "-user", $vpnUsername, "-password", $vpnPassword`

Save this script and set it to run on startup using the **Task Scheduler**.

### Linux Auto-Connect Script

For Linux, you can use the `openconnect` command-line tool (which is often used with GlobalProtect). Here's an example script:


`#!/bin/bash # Auto-connect to GlobalProtect VPN on startup  vpnPortal="vpn.yourcompany.com" vpnUsername="your-username" vpnPassword="your-password"  # Start VPN connection echo $vpnPassword | openconnect --user=$vpnUsername --passwd-on-stdin --protocol=gp $vpnPortal`

Save the script and set it to run at startup using **cron** or another automation tool.
